Paraver is a performance analyzer based on event traces with a great
flexibility to explore the collected data, supporting a detailed analysis of
the variability and distribution of multiple metrics with the objective of
understanding the applicationâ€™s behavior. Paraver has two main views: The
timeline view displays the application behavior over time, while the statistics
view (histograms, profiles) complements the analysis with distribution
of metrics.
